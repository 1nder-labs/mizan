/**
 * Brief workflow — Phase 4 inserts trust-signal steps between extractors and
 * matchPolicy, plus forcedEscalateGate + draftOrganizerMessage after
 * composeBrief.
 *
 * The three signal-extraction steps (photoSignal, storyCoherence,
 * classifyVouchingChain) run in `.parallel(...)` because they share no
 * data dependency on each other — only on the upstream extractions.
 * `mergeSignals` re-joins the parallel outputs into a single
 * `PartialBriefStateSchema` so every downstream step keeps the standard
 * step-input shape.
 *
 * Post-compose ordering: `forcedEscalateGate → draftOrganizerMessage →
 * awaitReviewerAction`. The gate fires first so an OFAC + community-
 * vouching REQUEST_DOCS case is overridden to ESCALATE before the
 * draft LLM runs — `draftOrganizerMessage` then sees ESCALATE and
 * short-circuits, saving a call.
 *
 * `awaitReviewerAction` is the TERMINAL step. It calls `step.suspend()`
 * which closes the workflow stream cleanly with `status: "suspended"`.
 * The post-action chain (record reviewer_actions, append to
 * eval_promotions, flip case to ACTIONED, emit workflow.finish) is
 * owned by `POST /api/cases/:id/action` directly, NOT a Mastra resume.
 *
 * Why no Mastra resume: `Workflow.resume()` from a different request
 * than the original `Workflow.stream()` hits Cloudflare Workers' I/O
 * isolation boundary ("Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different
 * request"). The post-action work is three deterministic D1 writes —
 * better expressed as direct route logic than as a workflow chain
 * that the runtime cannot complete cross-request. See
 * `apps/worker/src/routes/actions.ts` for the inline implementation.
